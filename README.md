# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This is my project repository for the Coursera class entitled [Getting and Cleaning Data] (https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata).  This project's goal is to read the **Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set** and to perform an analysis on this data.

This repository contains the following files:

1. **README.md** - this file describing the repository's purpose and contents
2. **CodeBook.md** - a file describing the analysis conducted and the variables used
3. **run_analysis.R** - the R script used to conduct the analysis and generate the output
4. **tidy.txt** - the output file generated by the run_analysis.R script

If attempting to use the run_analysis.R script, it assumes the following:

* The raw data has been downloaded from (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 
* The raw data has been unzipped and the structure has not been altered.
* The run_analysis.R script has been placed at the root of the unzipped directory structure
* The working directory is set to the root of the unzipped data set (i.e. "UCI HAR Dataset")

The resulting output file, tidy.txt will be found at the root of the unzipped data set (i.e. "UCI HAR Dataset")
